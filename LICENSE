The original concept of this particular text adventure came from a con-
versation with Ginger Alford about what type of game I should make. She
said she would make an HGTV simulator, and this idea stuck in my head.
Property Brothers, HGTV, and all related such things are copyright of
Scott Brothers Global & Scripps Networds, LLC respectively. All rights
reserved. This is just a goof for class, please don't be mad at me!

QA Testers: Ginger Alford.
